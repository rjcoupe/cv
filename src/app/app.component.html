    <h2>Profile</h2>
    <p>With a background of software development, Scrum Mastery and Product Ownership, I'm an Agile practitioner with a significant
      technical skillset. I both believe in the efficacy of and thoroughly enjoy the Agile mindset and methodologies to the
      point of faintly irritating my wife in my efforts to apply them to household tasks.</p>
    <p>I greatly enjoy "playing" with technology and taking opportunities to both learn new things and increase my knowledge
      of existing areas of expertise. I live for "projects", whether they have a tangibly useful outcome or are simply a
      vehicle for my efforts at trying a new technology or process.</p>
    <p>Outside of my work (and play), I'm a father to two wonderful children (with a third on the way) and a husband to an extremely
      tolerant wife. We live in Caerphilly, Wales, and can often be found out and about on country walks, whiling away the
      hours in play parks or trying to settle the important arguments that take place between a 5 year old and his 2 year
      old sister.</p>
